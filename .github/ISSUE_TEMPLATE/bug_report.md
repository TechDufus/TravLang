Welcome to travlang's Issue tracker!

travlang's developers use this tracker for bugs and feature requests only, rather
than user support.

If you have questions about *using* travlang, please ask at
https://discuss.travlang.org (more people read Discuss than this tracker, and
you'll get confirmation of whether you've really found a bug or need a new
feature).

If your error came from the travlang package manager, opam, (messages beginning
`[ERROR] The compilation of ...`), please start at
https://github.com/travlang/opam-repository/issues/new.

Some libraries and tools which used to be part of travlang are now maintained
separately. Please post questions about Graphics, Num, camlp4, LablTk, CamlDBM
or travlangTopWin on Discuss or on their respective issue trackers (see [README.adoc](https://github.com/travlang/travlang/blob/trunk/README.adoc#separately-maintained-components)
for a full list).
